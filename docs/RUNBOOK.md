# Runbook

Operational instructions will be completed as features are implemented.

## Local Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Planned Commands

```bash
python -m compileall -q app tests
quant-intel-brief
pytest
ruff check .
mypy app tests
```

`quant-intel-brief` and the web app are placeholders until Phase 0 wires the app factory.

## Incident Notes

- Source failures should degrade report coverage, not crash the entire daily run.
- Email delivery should require explicit configuration and log delivery results.
- LLM failures should preserve raw ranked items for manual review.
